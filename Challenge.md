# Technology Scavenger

In order to reach out to customers that would most likely benefit from using a system such as Talkdesk, a really useful way to do so is to find out which companies are already using technologies that we support as integrations so that we can then try to reach out to them and try to convince them that Talkdesk is a great fit.

## The Challenge

Given a [list of websites](https://github.com/talkdesk-challenges/challenges/raw/master/problems/assets/technology%20scavenger/alexa1M.zip), list all websites that use these technologies:

- Magento
- Shopify
- BigCommerce
- Zendesk
- Desk
- Freshdesk

Note: assume that this list is updated daily and the list of technologies can be 100x bigger (the code needs to be as optimized as possible; new technologies need to be easy to add).
